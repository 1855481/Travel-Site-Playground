# Welcome to our Travel Website

## How to use our Site
- At the top of the page, you will see a selection of different pages to look at. We have restaurants, parks, and beaches. 
- These pages give and in-depth description of famous and iconic places in San Diego.
- At the bottom of the page you can find locations via Google Maps of each place you want to visit, making it nice and simple for the user.

## TODO
- Look over the descriptions of each place, making sure it's easy to read and descriptive and not too redundant
- Jason, Dk, and Jacob will work on the Park page of our website, making sure to embed the links and provide a nice aesthetic to the page
- Marc will apply the layout. Jason, DK, and Jacob designed from the Park page onto the Restaurants page of the site, making changes to images and format when necessary via CSS
- Allen will then apply this layout to the Beaches page, making changes to backgrounds, formats, and images via CSS when necessary.
